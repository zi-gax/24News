                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has expressed concern over the potential economic impact of
                    President Trump's new tariffs, warning they could lead to higher inflation and slower growth. He
                    indicated that the Fed would adopt a cautious approach, waiting for more clarity before making any
                    interest rate decisions. Powell highlighted the risk of stagflation—a scenario of rising prices and
                    weakening economic growth—that could complicate the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining stable prices
                    and maximum employment. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has already affected markets, with
                    significant stock declines observed. Powell emphasized the need for careful monitoring of the
                    situation to guide future monetary policy decisions.</p>
